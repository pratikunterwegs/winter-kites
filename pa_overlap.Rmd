## Load PA files

```{r}
# read in data

# read in as list

## Load kite geopackages

## Link PA overlap with kite UD area

```{r}

# data now has zeros for PA types in each year if the kite
# did not overlap with that type

# check that all overlap areas are less than or equal to 1.0

## Total UD in protected areas

```{r}
